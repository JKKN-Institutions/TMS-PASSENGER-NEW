The JKKN TMS Passenger app is now a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** with full installation capabilities.

## Features Added

### 1. PWA Manifest (`public/manifest.json`)
- App name: "JKKN Transport Management System"

- Theme color: Green (#10b981)
- Display mode: Standalone (fullscreen app experience)
- 8 app icons (72x72 to 512x512)
- App shortcuts for quick access:
  - Dashboard

### 2. Service Worker (`public/sw.js`)
- Offline support with intelligent caching
- Network-first strategy for API calls
- Cache-first for static assets
- Automatic cache cleanup
- Push notification support (ready for future use)

### 3. Install Prompt Component (`components/pwa-install-prompt.tsx`)
- Beautiful custom install prompt
- Shows 3 seconds after page load
- Features list (faster loading, native experience, push notifications)
- Dismissible with 7-day cooldown
- Auto-hides if already installed
- Backdrop with blur effect

### 4. App Icons
- Generated 8 icon sizes (72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512)
- Green gradient background with bus emoji
- Maskable icons for Android adaptive icons
- Apple touch icon support

### 5. Configuration Updates
- **`app/layout.tsx`**: Added PWA metadata, manifest link, theme color, Apple web app tags
- **`next.config.ts`**: Added proper headers for Service Worker and manifest caching
- **`public/sw-register.js`**: Service Worker registration script with auto-update

## How It Works

### For Students (Android)
1. Visit the app in Chrome
2. After 3 seconds, a beautiful install prompt appears
3. Click "Install Now"
4. App icon appears on home screen
5. Opens fullscreen like a native app
6. Works offline with cached data

### For Students (iOS)
1. Visit the app in Safari
2. Tap the Share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. App icon appears on home screen
5. Opens fullscreen (limited offline support on iOS)

### For Desktop

2. Look for install icon in address bar
3. Click to install
4. App opens in its own window

## Testing the PWA

### Local Testing
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome and:
1. Wait for the install prompt
2. Open DevTools > Application > Manifest (verify manifest loads)
3. Check Service Workers tab (should see sw.js registered)
4. Click install prompt or use browser's install button

### Production Testing
After deployment:
1. Visit the live URL on mobile
2. Install prompt should appear after 3 seconds
3. Test installation flow
4. Test offline functionality (turn off network)
