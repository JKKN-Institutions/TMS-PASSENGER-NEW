# Staff Portal - Filtering Update

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Requirement

**Show ONLY data related to the staff member's assigned routes across all pages.**

Previously, some pages were showing ALL data from the database instead of filtering by the staff member's assigned routes.

---

## ✅ Pages Updated

### 1. Students Directory (`/staff/students/page.tsx`) ✅

**Before**: Showed ALL 137 students in the database

**After**: Shows ONLY students who are on the staff member's assigned routes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Get staff's assigned routes
const assignments = await supabase
  .from('staff_route_assignments')
  .select('route_id')
  .eq('staff_email', user.email)
  .eq('is_active', true);

// Step 2: Get students on these routes
const routeAllocations = await supabase
  .from('student_route_allocations')
  .select('...')
  .in('route_id', routeIds)  // ← Filter by assigned routes
  .eq('is_active', true);

// Step 3: Create unique students list
// (handles students who might be on multiple routes)
```

**Result**: Only students who board on staff's assigned routes are displayed

---

### 2. All Routes (`/staff/routes/page.tsx`) ✅

**Before**: Showed ALL routes in the system

**After**: Shows ONLY routes assigned to the staff member

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Get staff's assigned routes
const assignments = await supabase
  .from('staff_route_assignments')
  .select('route_id')
  .eq('staff_email', user.email)
  .eq('is_active', true);

// Step 2: Fetch only these routes
const routesData = await supabase
  .from('routes')
  .select('...')
  .in('id', routeIds);  // ← Filter by assigned route IDs
```

**Result**: Only assigned routes are displayed

---

### 3. Grievances Management (`/staff/grievances/page.tsx`) ✅

**Before**: Showed ALL grievances from ALL students

**After**: Shows ONLY grievances from students on the staff member's assigned routes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Get staff's assigned routes
const assignments = await supabase
  .from('staff_route_assignments')
  .select('route_id')
  .eq('staff_email', user.email)
  .eq('is_active', true);

// Step 2: Get students on these routes
const routeAllocations = await supabase
  .from('student_route_allocations')
  .select('student_id')
  .in('route_id', routeIds)
  .eq('is_active', true);

// Step 3: Fetch grievances only for these students
const grievancesData = await supabase
  .from('grievances')
  .select('...')
  .in('student_id', studentIds);  // ← Filter by route students
```

**Result**: Only grievances from students on assigned routes are displayed

---

### 4. Bookings Management (`/staff/bookings/page.tsx`) ✅

**Before**: Showed ALL bookings for the selected date

**After**: Shows ONLY bookings for the staff member's assigned routes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Get staff's assigned routes
const assignments = await supabase
  .from('staff_route_assignments')
  .select('route_id')
  .eq('staff_email', user.email)
  .eq('is_active', true);

// Step 2: Fetch bookings only for these routes
const bookingsData = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .select('...')
  .in('route_id', routeIds)  // ← Filter by assigned routes
  .eq('booking_date', selectedDate);
```

**Result**: Only bookings for assigned routes on selected date are displayed

## 📊 Impact on Data Display

### Example Scenario:

**Staff Member**: john@example.com
**Assigned Routes**: Route A, Route B, Route C

**Route A**: 15 students
**Route B**: 20 students
**Route C**: 10 students
**Other Routes**: 92 students (NOT assigned to this staff)

### Before Update:

| Page | Displayed | Correct? |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Students | 137 students (ALL) | ❌ No |
| Routes | 50 routes (ALL) | ❌ No |
| Grievances | 25 grievances (ALL) | ❌ No |
| Bookings | 30 bookings (ALL) | ❌ No |

### After Update:

| Page | Displayed | Correct? |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Students | 45 students (only from Routes A, B, C) | ✅ Yes |
| Routes | 3 routes (only A, B, C) | ✅ Yes |
| Grievances | 8 grievances (only from route students) | ✅ Yes |
| Bookings | 12 bookings (only for Routes A, B, C) | ✅ Yes |

---

## 🎯 Empty State Handling

All pages now properly handle the case when a staff member has **no routes assigned**:

```typescript
if (!assignments || assignments.length === 0) {
  setData([]);
  setFilteredData([]);
  setLoading(false);
  return;
}
```

**Display**: Shows "No data found" message with helpful text

---

## ✅ Pages Already Correct

These pages were already filtering correctly:

### 1. Dashboard (`/staff/page.tsx`) ✅
- Already uses `/api/staff/assigned-routes` API
- Shows only assigned routes data

### 2. Assigned Routes (`/staff/assigned-routes/page.tsx`) ✅
- Already uses `/api/staff/assigned-routes` API
- Shows only assigned routes

### 3. Route Details (`/staff/routes/[id]/page.tsx`) ✅
- Already filters by specific route ID
- Shows only passengers for that route

### 4. Reports (`/staff/reports/page.tsx`) ✅
- Report generation interface
- No data listing (generates reports on demand)

### 5. Profile (`/staff/profile/page.tsx`) ✅
- Shows staff member's own profile
- No filtering needed

---

## 🧪 Testing Verification

### Test Case 1: Staff with 2 Routes

**Setup**:
- Staff A has Routes 1 and 2
- Route 1: 10 students
- Route 2: 15 students
- Total other routes: 10 (not assigned)
- Total other students: 100 (on other routes)

**Expected**:
- Students page: Shows 25 students (10 + 15)
- Routes page: Shows 2 routes
- Grievances: Only from these 25 students
- Bookings: Only for Routes 1 and 2

### Test Case 2: Staff with NO Routes

**Setup**:
- Staff B has no routes assigned
- Database has 50 routes and 137 students

**Expected**:
- Students page: Empty state "No students found"
- Routes page: Empty state "No routes found"
- Grievances: Empty state "No grievances found"
- Bookings: Empty state "No bookings found"

### Test Case 3: Student on Multiple Staff Routes

**Setup**:
- Student X is on Route 1
- Staff A assigned to Route 1
- Staff B assigned to Route 2
- Student X appears once in Staff A's student list

**Expected**:
- Staff A sees Student X (on Route 1)
- Staff B does NOT see Student X
- No duplicate entries

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Complete Filter Chain:

```
1. Staff Login
   ↓
2. Get staff_email from auth
   ↓
3. Query staff_route_assignments
   WHERE staff_email = current_user.email
   AND is_active = true
   ↓
4. Extract route_ids [route-1, route-2, ...]
   ↓
5. Filter All Queries by These Routes:
   ↓
   ├─ Students:
   │  FROM student_route_allocations
   │  WHERE route_id IN (route_ids)
   │
   ├─ Routes:
   │  FROM routes
   │  WHERE id IN (route_ids)
   │
   ├─ Grievances:
   │  - Get student_ids from route allocations
   │  - FROM grievances
   │  - WHERE student_id IN (student_ids)
   │
   └─ Bookings:
      FROM bookings
      WHERE route_id IN (route_ids)
```
