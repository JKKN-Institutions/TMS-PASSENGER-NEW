## Key Functionalities

### 1. Dashboard Statistics
**Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
const totalRoutes = routes.length;
const totalPassengers = routes.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.passengerCount, 0);
const activeRoutes = routes.filter(r => r.route.status === 'active').length;
const totalCapacity = routes.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.route.total_capacity, 0);
```

### 2. Passenger Filtering
**Filter by Stop:**
```typescript
filtered = passengers.filter(p => p.boardingStop?.stop_name === selectedStop);
```

**Filter by Department:**
```typescript
filtered = passengers.filter(p => p.student.departments?.department_name === selectedDept);
```

### 3. Passenger Grouping
**Group by Boarding Stop:**
```typescript
const grouped = passengers.reduce((acc, p) => {
  const stop = p.boardingStop?.stop_name || 'Unassigned';
  if (!acc[stop]) acc[stop] = [];
  acc[stop].push(p);
  return acc;
}, {});

// Sort by sequence order
Object.entries(grouped).sort((a, b) =>
  a[1][0].boardingStop.sequence_order - b[1][0].boardingStop.sequence_order
);
```

### 4. CSV Export
**Export Format:**
```csv
Name,Roll Number,Email,Mobile,Department,Program,Year,Semester,Boarding Stop,Stop Time
Student Name,123456,student@example.com,9876543210,CSE,B.E CS,2,3,Stop 1,08:15
```

**Export Function:**
```typescript
const exportPassengerList = () => {
  const csvContent = [
    ['Name', 'Roll Number', 'Email', ...].join(','),
    ...passengers.map(p => [
      p.student.student_name,
      p.student.roll_number,
      ...
    ].join(','))
  ].join('\n');

  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: 'text/csv' });
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = url;
  a.download = `route-${routeNumber}-passengers-${date}.csv`;
  a.click();
};
```

    setError(data.error || 'Failed to load data');
  }
} catch (err) {
  setError('Network error or server unavailable');
}
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Stats not loading**
- Check API endpoint is accessible
- Verify staff email in session
- Check browser console for errors

**Issue: Passengers not showing**
- Verify route has passengers assigned
- Check filters aren't too restrictive
- Ensure database has student_route_allocations

**Issue: CSV export not working**
- Check browser allows downloads
- Verify filtered passengers exist
- Check browser console for errors

**Issue: Navigation not working**
- Verify staff is authenticated
- Check userType === 'staff'
- Ensure routes are defined in layout

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Staff must be authenticated to access
- Email verified from session
- No guest access allowed

### Authorization
- Staff can only see their assigned routes
- No access to other staff's routes
- API validates email ownership

### Data Protection
- Passenger data shown only to assigned staff
- No sensitive data in URLs
- CSV export includes filtered data only

---

## Performance Metrics

### Target Metrics
- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds
- **API Response:** < 500ms
- **CSV Export:** < 1 second for 100 passengers
- **Filter Update:** < 100ms

### Optimization Tips
- Enable API caching
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Lazy load passenger details
- Compress CSV before download
