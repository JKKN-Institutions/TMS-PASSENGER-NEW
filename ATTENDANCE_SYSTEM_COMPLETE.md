# Staff Attendance System - Complete Implementation ✅

## Overview
A comprehensive attendance tracking system for staff to scan passenger tickets and automatically record student attendance when boarding the transport.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
**Table: `attendance`**
- Records student boarding when tickets are scanned
- Automatically links to bookings, students, routes, and schedules
- Prevents duplicate scans with unique constraint per booking per trip
- Includes RLS policies for data security

**Key Features:**
- Auto-timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at, scanned_at)
- Staff authentication verification
- GPS location tracking (optional)
- QR code and booking reference storage
- Status tracking: present, absent, cancelled

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Scan Ticket API
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/staff/scan-ticket`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "ticketCode": "BOOKING_REF_OR_QR",
  "staffEmail": "staff@example.com",
  "scanLocation": "optional-gps-coordinates"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Attendance recorded successfully",
  "attendance": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "student_name": "John Doe",
    "roll_number": "CS2024001",
    "route_number": "R001",
    "boarding_stop": "Main Gate",
    "scanned_at": "2025-10-31T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "present"
  },
  "alreadyScanned": false
}
```

**Features:**
- Validates staff assignment to route
- Prevents duplicate scans
- Updates booking verification status
- Records full attendance details

#### 2. Attendance History API
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/staff/attendance`

**Query Parameters:**
- `routeId` (optional): Filter by specific route
- `date` (required): Trip date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `staffEmail` (required): Staff member's email

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "attendance": [...],
  "stats": {
    "total": 25,
    "present": 24,
    "absent": 1,
    "cancelled": 0,
    "byRoute": { "R001": 15, "R002": 10 },
    "byStop": { "Main Gate": 10, "Bus Stand": 15 }
  },
  "date": "2025-10-31"
}
```

### Helper Functions

**Added to `lib/staff-helpers.ts`:**

```typescript
// Scan a ticket and record attendance
async scanTicket(ticketCode: string, staffEmail: string, scanLocation?: string)

// Get attendance records for a route and date
async getAttendance(params: { routeId?: string; date?: string; staffEmail: string })
```

### Frontend Implementation

#### Attendance Scanning Page
**Location:** `app/staff/attendance/page.tsx`

**Features:**
1. **Real-time Scanning**
   - Camera-based QR code scanning
   - Manual ticket code entry
   - Instant feedback on scan success/failure

2. **Statistics Dashboard**
   - Total scanned tickets
   - Present/Absent/Cancelled counts
   - Attendance rate percentage
   - Grouped by route and stop

3. **Filters**
   - Date selector with quick navigation (Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow)
   - Route filter for staff with multiple assignments
   - Real-time data refresh

4. **Attendance Records Display**
   - Student name and roll number
   - Route and boarding stop details
   - Scan timestamp and staff who scanned
   - Seat number and payment status
   - Visual status indicators (Present/Absent/Cancelled)

## Navigation Integration

**Updated:** `app/staff/layout.tsx`

- Added "Attendance" to main sidebar navigation
- Added to bottom navigation bar (replacing Routes)
- Included UserCheck icon for visual consistency
- Positioned prominently after Dashboard

## Security Features

1. **Route Assignment Verification**
   - Staff can only scan tickets for assigned routes
   - Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized

2. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Database constraint ensures one attendance record per booking per trip
   - Returns friendly message if already scanned

3. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Students can view their own attendance
   - Staff can view/create attendance for assigned routes
   - Admins have full access

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Foreign key constraints ensure valid references
   - Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity
   - Auto-update triggers for timestamps

## Usage Flow

### For Staff Members:

1. **Navigate to Attendance**
   - Click "Attendance" in sidebar or bottom nav
   - View today's attendance statistics

2. **Scan Student Tickets**
   - Option A: Click "Open Scanner" to use camera
   - Option B: Manually enter booking reference/QR code
   - Submit to record attendance

3. **View Attendance Records**
   - See real-time list of all scanned tickets
   - Filter by date and route
   - Export/review historical data

4. **Monitor Statistics**
   - Track attendance rate
   - Identify no-shows
   - Generate reports for management

### For Passengers:

1. **Generate Ticket**
   - Book transport through passenger app
   - Receive booking confirmation with QR code
   - QR code contains booking_reference or qr_code field

2. **Board Transport**
   - Show QR code or booking reference to staff
   - Staff scans using attendance system
   - Receive confirmation of attendance recorded

## Database Migration

**File:** `migrations/create_attendance_table.sql`

**To Apply:**
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
npx supabase db push

# Or using SQL editor in Supabase Dashboard
# Copy and execute the migration SQL
```

**Includes:**
- Table creation with all columns and constraints
- Indexes for performance optimization
- RLS policies for security
- Triggers for auto-timestamps
- View for attendance summary

## Testing Checklist

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:

2. `app/api/staff/scan-ticket/route.ts` - Scan endpoint
3. `app/api/staff/attendance/route.ts` - History endpoint
4. `app/staff/attendance/page.tsx` - UI page

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/staff-helpers.ts` - Added scanning functions
2. `app/staff/layout.tsx` - Added navigation item

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Run the migration SQL in Supabase
   - Verify tables and policies created successfully

2. **QR Code Integration:**
   - Ensure passenger tickets contain booking_reference
   - Test scanning flow end-to-end

3. **Camera Permissions:**
   - Handle camera permission denials gracefully
   - Add fallback to manual entry if camera unavailable

4. **Reporting:**
   - Create attendance reports page
   - Export attendance data to CSV/PDF
   - Generate daily/weekly/monthly summaries

5. **Notifications:**
   - Send notifications to students on successful scan
   - Alert staff of booking issues
   - Notify parents of student attendance

## Technical Notes

- Camera API uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`
- Prefers rear camera (`facingMode: 'environment'`)
- Gracefully handles camera access denial
- Supports both QR code scanning and manual entry
- Real-time data refresh after each scan
- Auto-clears success messages after 3 seconds

## Benefits

✅ **Automated Attendance** - No manual roll call needed
✅ **Real-time Tracking** - Instant attendance records

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check API logs in Supabase Dashboard
- Verify staff route assignments in database
