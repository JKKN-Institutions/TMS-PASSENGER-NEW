## 🎯 What's Been Fixed

### 1. **User Data Enhancement**
**Problem:** User objects from auth server didn't include local database IDs.  
**Solution:** Auth context now automatically fetches and merges local database student records.

### 2. **Token Storage**
**Problem:** Tokens were stored with wrong keys, causing authentication failures.  
**Solution:** Standardized token storage keys (`tms_*`) across localStorage and cookies.

### 3. **Dashboard Data Display**
**Problem:** Pages showed "no routes allocated" because studentId was missing.  
**Solution:** User enhancement now populates all required fields before dashboard loads.

### 4. **Page Navigation**
**Problem:** Some pages couldn't access user data or showed errors.  
**Solution:** Complete user object with database IDs available across all pages.

## 🚀 Ready for Manual Testing

### Quick Start:
1. **Open a new terminal**
2. **Navigate to passenger app:**
   ```bash
   cd TMS-PASSENGER
   ```
3. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3003
   ```
5. **Follow the detailed test guide:**
   - See `AUTHENTICATION_TEST_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing steps

## 🔍 What to Test

### Priority 1: Core Authentication
- [ ] Log in with `student@jkkn.ac.in`
- [ ] Verify tokens stored in localStorage
- [ ] Check console for enhancement logs
- [ ] Verify user object has `studentId` and `rollNumber`

### Priority 2: Dashboard Display
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Enrollment status displays correctly
- [ ] No "no routes allocated" error (if student is enrolled)
- [ ] User information displays correctly

### Priority 3: Navigation & Persistence
- [ ] Navigate to Profile, Routes, Notifications pages
- [ ] Refresh page - should stay logged in
- [ ] All pages work without errors

### Priority 4: Logout & Security
- [ ] Logout clears all tokens
- [ ] Redirects to login page
- [ ] Protected pages require re-authentication

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Check These First:
1. **Clear browser cache completely** (localStorage, cookies, session storage)
2. **Check console for error messages** (look for ❌ symbols)
3. **Verify .env.local has correct redirect URI**
   - For local testing: `http://localhost:3003/auth/callback`
   - For production: `https://tms.jkkn.ac.in/auth/callback`
4. **Check network tab** for failed API calls

### Common Issues:

**Issue: Redirect Loop**
- Clear localStorage and cookies
- Verify tokens are being saved (check Application tab in DevTools)
- Check that `window.location.href` is used for redirect (not `router.push`)

**Issue: "Student not found"**
- Check that email exists in `students` table
- Verify `external_student_id` column exists and is populated
- Check console for database enhancement logs

**Issue: "No routes allocated"**
- Verify user object has `studentId` field
- Check that `studentId` is being used in API calls
- Look at Network tab for `/api/enrollment/status` response

**Issue: 401 Unauthorized**
- Check that `tms_access_token` exists in localStorage
- Verify token is not expired
- Check that API calls include `Authorization` header
