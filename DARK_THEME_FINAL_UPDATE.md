# Dark Theme Final Update - Complete Implementation

## ‚úÖ All Components Now Properly Themed!

This update addresses the user's concern that the dark theme "wasn't implemented properly." All visible dashboard components now have complete dark theme support with neon accents.

---

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### Issue
The user screenshot showed the dashboard in **light mode**, but several components weren't properly styled for dark theme. The "Active Term Period" card and other dashboard elements needed dark theme implementation.

### Solution
Comprehensively updated ALL dashboard components with proper dark theme classes using neon color palette (green, yellow, blue, orange).
